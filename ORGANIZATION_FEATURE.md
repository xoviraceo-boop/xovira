# Organization & Department Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully extended the Xovira platform from Project/Workspace-level operations to **Organization-level** operations with **Department** support. This enables hierarchical governance, department-based autonomy, and organization-wide agent deployment.

## Database Schema Changes

  ownerId       String
  logo          String?
  domain        String?

## Use Cases Enabled

### 1. Multi-Organization Management

- Organizations can create functional departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, etc.)
- Projects and teams can be assigned to departments
- Department-level metrics and tracking

### 3. Organization-Level Agents
- Deploy AI agents at organization or department level
- Agents can operate across all projects in a department
- Centralized agent management

### 4. Hierarchical Governance
```
Organization
├── Departments
│   ├── Projects
│   ├── Teams
│   └── AI Agents
├── Workspaces
└── Members
```

### 5. Linking Existing Entities
- Link existing workspaces to organizations
- Assign projects to departments
- Organize teams by department
- Deploy agents to specific departments

## API Examples

### Create Organization
```typescript
POST /v1/organizations
{
  "name": "Acme Corporation",
  "slug": "acme-corp",
  "domain": "acme.com"
}
```

### Create Department
```typescript
POST /v1/organizations/:orgId/departments
{
  "name": "Engineering",
  "description": "Product development team",
  "color": "#3B82F6"
}
```

### Link Project to Department
```typescript
POST /v1/organizations/:orgId/link/project/:projectId
{
  "departmentId": "dept_123"
}
```

### Deploy Agent to Department
```typescript
POST /v1/organizations/:orgId/link/agent/:agentId
{
  "departmentId": "dept_123"
}
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Member Management UI** - Add/remove organization members, role assignment
2. **Department Dashboard** - Dedicated view for department-level analytics
3. **Bulk Operations** - Link multiple projects/teams to departments at once
4. **Organization Settings** - Branding, permissions, integrations
5. **Department Agents** - Pre-configured agents for common department functions
6. **Cross-Department Collaboration** - Shared resources, inter-department projects
7. **Organization Analytics** - Aggregate metrics across all departments
8. **Access Control** - Fine-grained permissions at org/dept level

### Technical Improvements
1. Add caching for organization queries
2. Implement real-time updates for organization changes
3. Add search/filter for large organization lists
4. Implement organization switching UI
5. Add organization-level settings and preferences

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Data
- All existing entities (Projects, Teams, Workspaces, Agents) remain functional
- `organizationId` and `departmentId` are optional fields
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Organizations can be created and entities linked gradually

### Database Migration
```bash
cd packages/database
npx prisma db push
```

This will:
- Create new `organizations`, `organization_members`, `departments` tables
- Add nullable `organizationId`, `departmentId` columns to existing tables
- Preserve all existing data
